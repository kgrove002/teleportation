        <h2 class="subHeading">Who Would They Be for?</h2>
        <p class="text">
            As with all technology, the teleporters would more than likely be exclusive to testing groups, then hit the market at a high price. However, just as we have seen with more gadgets, as the technology becomes more affordable and perfected, it will branch out to all economic classes. In due time, a teleporter would become just as common in a household as a television. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="subHeading">Save Time</h2>
        <p class="text">
            Imagine wanting to take a trip across the world. You just book your flight, hotel, and rental car. Now you only have to survive an 8 to 15-hour flight for a two to five-day trip. Would it not be great to just step in a pod and transport there in under a second? With teleportation, this would be possible. Working those big jobs without having to live in the cities would also be possible. Teleportation would enable society to make more money and save more time. This would allow people to spend more time with their families.            
        </p>
        <h2 class="subHeading">Save Money</h2>
        <p class="text">
            With the ability to transport anywhere in the world in under a second, people would make more money because they would have access to all jobs, not just the ones in their area. Another thing that may end up in the past would be cars. There would still be people who want to drive them for the sake of driving them; however, the main transportation would end up becoming the teleporters. With the ability to teleport anywhere in the world in under a second, why would anyone need a car payment and insurance?
