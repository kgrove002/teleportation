        <h1 class="heading">What Is Teleportation</h1>
        <p class="text">Teleportation can be a tricky topic. Scientifically, it means moving one object or person to another place without physically moving them. Currently, this is not possible for people as there are still many problems to work out before humans can teleport. Currently, teleportation can only be achieved at a quantum level, a space which is far too small for any person to see.</p>
        <h1 class="heading">What Struggles Are Being Faced?</h1>
        <p class="text">The first and main problem is the fact that a person has 10<sup>28</sup> atoms, and currently, mankind can only move one or two atoms. Moving that many atoms in an instant is a feat that mankind is not able to accomplish at this time. The next issue is with human DNA and biomatter. After moving the person to their desired destination, they would need to be put back together in the same way, or else who knows what would happen. This will require the work of physicists, human biologists, and engineers as a whole to achieve what we see in Star Trek.</p>
        <h1 class="heading">Potential Problems</h1>
        <p class="text">
            With any new technology, there will be those who will want to misuse it. Laws would need to be put into action that require the creators of this technology to ensure that it is not misused. Governments would need to create mandates that make certain places unauthorized to enter, such as a home one does not own or a government official building.
        </p>
        <p class="text">Another potential problem is how this technology will be powered. As it is not yet invented, this is unknown. If the technology is powered by nuclear power, the waste would need to be dealt with accordingly to ensure the environment is not damaged. Hopefully, there will be an eco-friendly power source developed for this technology in the long run. </p>
